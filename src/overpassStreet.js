 * @param {Object} osmConfig The osm config
 * @param {Object} osmConfig.minimumWayLength. The minimum lengths of way features to return. Defaults to 20 meters.
 * @param {Object} location A Location object.
 * @param {Number} [location.osmId], Optional osmId to limit the area of the queries. If this isn't defined then nominatm is queried to get it

 * The results contain nodes and ways of the streets, where nodes are where intersections occur
 * There must be at least on way and possibly more
 * Some blocks have more than two nodes if they have multiple divided ways.
