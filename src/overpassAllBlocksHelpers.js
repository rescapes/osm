/**
 * Given partial blocks, meaning blocks with a way intersection node and a way segment, build up complete blocks. The partial blocks
 * duplicated for each way segment starting at either node with ways ordered from that node toward the next.
 * Illustration. The following is one way segment represented as two partial blocks. The first includes the
 * node on the left and the way nodes in the direction of the arrow. The second includes the node on the right
 * with the same way nodes in the direction of the arrow.
 *  n ---->(n)
 * (n)<---- n
 * Partial blocks are each followed beginning at the first node of the first way in partial blocks. They are processed
 * sequentially with the caveat that once a partial block is consumed in one direction it's twin is removed from the
 * remaining list. The other caveat is that some node intersections are not true intersections, rather places where
 * ways change but the street is the same. In this case we continue building the block until we get to a true
 * intersection node and we remove the traversed partial blocks to prevent later traversal.
 *
 * The end result is a complete set of blocks, where a block has at least two nodes and at least one way in between
 * those nodes. Multiple ways within a block are ordered but the direction is arbitrary based on which partial block
 * was found first.
 *
 * Another exception is dead end ways and ways whose final intersection node was not part of the query results.
 * When a dead end is encountered, we query the way to find out if actually has an intersection node that wasn't
 * part of the original query results. Then we use that result. If the way is truly a dead end, we use the way
 node the that the block has a node at both ends of the way(s)
